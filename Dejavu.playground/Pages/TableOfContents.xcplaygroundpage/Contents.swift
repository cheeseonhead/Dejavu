 # Déjà vu
 - Important: During development, several playground bugs have come up, listed below.
    1. Sometimes the timeline on the right hand side doesn't correctly display the simulator, a restart to XCode is usually required.
    2. Sometimes the map views don't display the names of locations, only displays the landscape. It doesn't affect the demonstration of the app. A re-run solves the problem 60% of the time.
 
 Have you ever been in a situation where you suddenly feel like you have dont this before? That's a creepy feeling we call **Déjà vu**. It's a strange physical sensation written off by science as a meaningless and explainable biological phenomena centered in the brain. But for people that don't totally believe in that, usually try to break the **Déjà vu** by doing something different. It could be screaming out a weird phrase, or dancing some weird dance moves.
 
 But how can you make sure you actually broke the **Déjà vu**?
 
 The answer is: *You can't*
 
 That's why this app was created, it's here to make sure you don't fall into an endless loop of time.
 
 On each page of the playground, you will learn about one significant function of the app.
