 # Déjà vu
 - Important: During development, several playground bugs have come up, listed below.
    1. Sometimes the timeline on the right hand side doesn't correctly display the simulator, a restart to XCode is usually required.
    2. Sometimes the map views don't display the names of locations, only displays the landscape. It doesn't affect the demonstration of the app. A re-run solves the problem 60% of the time.
 
 This app was created for situations where you feel like you have experienced this before, but you're not sure how to break the **Déjà vu**.
 
 On each page of the playground, you will learn about one significant function of the app.
